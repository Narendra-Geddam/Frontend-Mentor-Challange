        background-color: white;
        width: 85%;
        margin: auto;
        border-radius: 5%;
        padding: 10px;
    }

        {
            color: black;
            font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;

### Continued development

I'm very much intrested to develop like this project to develope websites and web application. 


### Useful resources

- W3 Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) - This helped me for complete task like html and css. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Bootstrap. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
